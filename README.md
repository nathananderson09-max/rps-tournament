# Rock-Paper-Scissors Tournament - CSCI210 Final Project

## Project Structure

```
project/
├── app.py                  # Main Flask application with API endpoints
├── templates/
│   └── index.html         # Frontend HTML with JavaScript
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
└── README.md             # This file
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install Flask directly:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

### 2. Run the Server

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### 3. Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## How to Play

1. **First Game Setup**:
   - Enter names for both Player 1 and Player 2
   - Click "Start New Game"

2. **Playing Rounds**:
   - Player 1 selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors
   - Player 2's choice is randomly generated by the computer
   - Each game consists of 10 rounds
   - Scores are updated after each round

3. **Winner Retention**:
   - After a game completes, the winner is automatically retained as Player 1
   - You must enter a new Player 2 name for the next game
   - This ensures tracking of at least 5 unique players

4. **Leaderboard**:
   - View all players sorted by name (alphabetically)
   - View all players sorted by score (descending)
   - Scores and games won are tracked across all games

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/player/register
- Registers a new player in the system
- Body: `{"player_name": "string"}`

### POST /api/game/start
- Starts a new 10-round game
- Body: `{"player1": "string", "player2": "string"}`

### POST /api/game/play_round
- Plays one round of Rock-Paper-Scissors
- Body: `{"player1_choice": "rock/paper/scissors", "player2_choice": "rock/paper/scissors"}`

### GET /api/leaderboard
- Returns leaderboard sorted by name and score
- Response includes both sorted views

### GET /api/game/state
- Returns current game state
- Useful for checking last winner

## Data Structures Used

### 1. Dictionary (LEADERBOARD)
- **Purpose**: Central data store for all player statistics
- **Structure**: `{player_name: {"score": int, "games_won": int}}`
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for lookups and updates

### 2. Lists & Sorting
- **Purpose**: Generate sorted views of leaderboard
- **Implementation**: Dictionary converted to list, then sorted by name or score
- **Algorithms**: Python's `sorted()` with lambda key functions

## Key Features Implemented

✅ Dictionary-based central data store (LEADERBOARD)  
✅ List conversion and sorting for leaderboard display  
✅ 10-round game logic  
✅ Winner retention for next game  
✅ RESTful API endpoints  
✅ Dual-view leaderboard (by name and score)  
✅ Persistent player tracking across multiple games  

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Register multiple players (at least 5 unique names)
- [ ] Play complete 10-round games
- [ ] Verify winner retention after game completion
- [ ] Check leaderboard updates after each game
- [ ] Verify both leaderboard sorting methods work
- [ ] Test tie scenarios
- [ ] Ensure player names can't be duplicated

## Next Steps for Enhancement

1. Add data persistence (save to file/database)
2. Add player avatars or icons
3. Implement tournament brackets
4. Add game history/replay feature
5. Add statistics (win percentage, favorite choice, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Port 5000 already in use  
**Solution**: Change the port in `app.py`: `app.run(debug=True, port=5001)`

**Issue**: Flask not found  
**Solution**: Make sure you installed Flask: `pip install Flask`

**Issue**: Template not found  
**Solution**: Ensure `templates/` folder exists in the same directory as `app.py`
